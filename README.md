# Growth
A computer model of crystal growth using simple assumptions.

This program is written for the class *NANO 701: MBE for quantum nanostructures and devices* and it is a simple intuitive computer model of crystal growth, which focuses on step growth on vicinal
surfaces and spiral growth originating at a screw dislocation.
